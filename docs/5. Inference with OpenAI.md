While open access models such as Llama 2 are making great progress, they still lag behind in performance when compared with models created by OpenAI, such as GPT3.5 and GPT4. This may be due to raw model size, better data, or model architecture. Very few details about OpenAI's models are public, making this hard to determine. 

## 5.1. Sentiment Analysis with OpenAI 

Automated access to OpenAI's model is available only through their paid API. 
This example uses the same task and dataset as in Section [[3. Inference]]. You can create an account on [their page](https://openai.com/blog/openai-api), but keep in mind that they charge [by the token](https://openai.com/pricing), which can quickly add up with large datasets. 

Adapting GPT models at tasks such as classification also relies on appropriate use of prompting. Fortunately, GPT models in general are quite good at following instructions and sticking to a specific output format, as long as this is clearly expressed. The example notebook below shows an example of prompting the GPT3.5 model to perform sentiment analysis on a sample of the IMDB dataset.
